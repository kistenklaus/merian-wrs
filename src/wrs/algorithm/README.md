This directory contains algorithm!

A algorithm might be one or more compute pipelies that are submitted together and
that perform some purpose all algorithm pipelines are a class and 
have a associative Buffers struct whicht contains and documents the format of input 
and output buffers. 

Algorithms only perform internal synchronization all external synchronization has to done by the test suit 
or other algorithms that use this algorithm as a substep.
